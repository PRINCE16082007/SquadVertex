            <h1>SquadVertex — Event Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective:</strong> August 19, 2025</p>
        </header>
        
        <p class="applicable-to"><strong>Applies to:</strong> All SquadVertex-hosted events. (Third-party collab events are covered only when the event page explicitly says so.)</p>
        
        <div class="primer">
            These terms define how events are created, scheduled, run, and paid on SquadVertex — including creator responsibilities, prize pool mechanics, scheduling workflows, postponement/cancellation mechanics, and security rules. For refunds/compensation/disputes, see the Refund & Dispute Policy page.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Creator:</strong> a SquadVertex account that initiates or co-hosts an event and contributes the required seed/fee.</p>
            <p><strong>Participant / Player:</strong> any user who joins or competes in an event.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed / Minimum:</strong> the required fee per creator to start an event (per event page). Every creator in a given event must meet the seed requirement unless the event page explicitly states different contribution rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Prize Pool / GP:</strong> the combined money that will be used for event prizes (seed + donations as described on the event page). Prize distribution is defined per event.</p>
            <p><strong>Support Team:</strong> SquadVertex staff who manage tickets, create the private creator chat room, verify payments, and schedule events. Contact via squadvertex24official@gmail.com.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. How to Start an Event (Workflow)</h2>
            <p><em>Required flow for all event creation.</em></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ticket Creation:</strong> The prospective event host creates a ticket via the Support system requesting to host an event. This ticket is the official start of the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Creation Space:</strong> Support will create a private, dedicated chat room that includes Support + the creators who opt in for that event. Creators must find/confirm collaborators themselves (Support facilitates the space but does not recruit participants for you).</li>
                <li><strong>Scheduling & Agreement:</strong> In that private room creators coordinate date/time, rules, and exact seed amount. Creators are expected to reach consensus there.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment & Form Submission:</strong> Once creators agree, each creator will submit payment (PayPal primary; UPI for India) and complete the event submission form. Payment receipts must clearly show payer identity and amount; receipts are used for verification.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Confirmation:</strong> After Support verifies payments and form data, Support finalizes the scheduled event. Only after Support confirmation is the event considered scheduled and listed publicly.</li>
                <li>All official communications and changes must happen through the private chat room and the designated Support pages/forms.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Payment Rules & Prize Pool Basics</h2>
            <p><strong>Per-creator contribution required:</strong> Every creator in the event must contribute the required seed as listed for that event. Events where creators pay unequal amounts are not valid unless the larger contribution is explicitly declared at payout time and is clearly visible on the payment receipt. If unequal payments are not declared on the record, the event does not meet criteria and may be cancelled.</p>
            <p><strong>No partial acceptance of uneven pools:</strong> The platform will not auto-balance uneven contribution unless written and receipt-backed agreement exists at payment time.</p>
            <p><strong>Prize pool composition:</strong> The prize pool (GP) is composed as declared on the event page (commonly seed + donations). Prize split and platform share are defined on the event page. Creators and participants must follow the prize distribution rules posted for the event.</p>
            <p><strong>Verification:</strong> Support performs manual verification of all payments and receipts prior to event finalization and prior to any payouts.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Scheduling, Cutoffs, and Finalization</h2>
            <p><strong>Event finalization:</strong> An event is finalized and public only after Support has verified required payments and the creators have submitted the completed event form.</p>
            <p><strong>Confirmation window:</strong> Creators must respond to any Support confirmation requests within the timelines provided in the private chat; email confirmations (Yes / No) are used for certain cancellation workflows as described below.</p>
            <p><strong>Relist / relaunch rule:</strong> If an event is cancelled and later relaunched, creators may not relaunch the exact same event for 14 days (cooldown to prevent gaming).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Cancellation & Postponement</h2>
            <p><strong>Where to cancel/postpone:</strong> Cancellation and postponement requests must be submitted through the dedicated Cancel/Postpone portal (a single page/form that handles both actions). The form includes fields for reason and — for postponements — the desired new date.</p>
            <p><strong>Minimum submission windows:</strong> Creators must submit cancellation requests and postponement requests per the timeline published on the event page and in the private chat. (Support will provide the exact cutoffs for each event.)</p>
            <p><strong>Postponement allowance:</strong> Creators may request a postponement up to the published cutoff (see event page/private chat). Postponements must be submitted via the same portal used for cancellations and will be processed by Support.</p>
            <p><strong>Anti-gaming rule (postponement & cancellation):</strong> Postponement must not be used to manipulate scheduling or cancellation deadlines. If a postponement appears to have been used to game the scheduling window, Support will treat that case as abuse and may apply adverse measures (including but not limited to different remedial mechanics or denials) defined in platform policy. Creators are expected to be honest and reasonable when postponing.</p>
            <p><strong>Notifications & communication:</strong> Support will send confirmation emails that include the event details and the person who filed the cancellation/postponement. Creators must use the private chat plus the portal to complete the workflow — direct email alone does not finalize a cancellation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Unequal Contributions & Special Payouts</h2>
            <p>If one creator contributes a significantly larger amount and wants that to be recognized in payouts, that must be:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Declared in writing at the time of payout submission, and</li>
                <li>Clearly visible on the payment receipt submitted to Support.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Without written declaration and matching receipt evidence, the event will be evaluated as equal-seed event per the rules on the event page, and unequal contributions will not be honored.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. Prize Distribution & GP Handling</h2>
            <p>Prize split, platform cut, and distribution mechanics are controlled by the event page or the event listing and become binding once Support finalizes the event. Creators must follow the distribution algorithm published for the event.</p>
            <p>Support manually verifies the GP and donation totals before any winner payouts or credits are released.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Payout Methods & Currency</h2>
            <p><strong>Payout channels:</strong> PayPal is the primary payment channel for international users. UPI is available for Indian users.</p>
            <p><strong>Currency:</strong> The platform supports the currency shown on the event page. Creator reporting and receipts must match the currency of payment.</p>
            <p><strong>Payment reconciliation:</strong> Support reconciles receipts with received funds prior to payout.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>9. Support Role & Private Chat Expectations</h2>
            <p><strong>Support will:</strong> create the private creation chat, verify payments, confirm scheduling, publish the final schedule, and assist with portal workflows (cancel/postpone).</p>
            <p><strong>Creators are expected to:</strong> proactively coordinate in the private chat, present clear payment receipts, and follow Support instructions for scheduling and forms. Support will not recruit creators for you; creators must bring collaborators into the private room themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>10. Security, Abuse & Termination</h2>
            <p>SquadVertex uses automated and manual security systems (EXELIS included) to detect fraud, bots, manipulation, and other abusive behavior. Credible detection will lead to immediate review and may result in account suspension or termination and further action.</p>
            <p>If an account is suspended or terminated for suspected abuse, Support will notify the affected account and provide instructions for requesting review. Resolution and any payout/action will follow SquadVertex’s internal review procedures and the Refund & Dispute Policy as applicable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>11. Evidence, Verification & Cooperation</h2>
            <p>All scheduling, cancellation, payment, and dispute matters require documented evidence provided through the platform forms and private chat. Support may request additional proof and will not act on incomplete claims. Creators must cooperate fully and promptly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>12. Third-Party Collab Events</h2>
            <p>Third-party events are included under these terms only if the specific event page explicitly states SquadVertex-hosted status or delegates these mechanics to SquadVertex. If the event is run by a third party and not SquadVertex-hosted, those events may be governed by separate terms (posted on that event’s page).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>13. Acceptance & Updates</h2>
            <p>By participating in or creating an event you accept these Event Terms and acknowledge that Support will manage scheduling via tickets and private chat. SquadVertex may update these terms; material changes will be posted on the site. For detailed procedural rules, and for refunds, compensation, and disputes, refer to the Refund & Dispute Policy.</p>
