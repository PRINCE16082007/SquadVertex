        <h1>SquadVertex — Refund & Dispute Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective:</strong> August 19, 2025</p>
        <p class="disclaimer"><strong>Scope:</strong> This is the site-wide Refund Policy. It applies to the entire SquadVertex website.</p>

        <div class="tldr">
            <h3>TL;DR: Short & Clear</h3>
            <ul class="list-compact">
                <li><strong>Only Events</strong> are eligible for cash refunds (under narrow conditions).</li>
                <li><strong>Everything else is final:</strong> Donations, subscriptions, digital assets, completed services, promotions, trials = <strong>non-refundable</strong>.</li>
                <li>Refunds for eligible Events are <strong>50%</strong> of the money SquadVertex actually received (after processor/GST fees).</li>
                <li>Refunds are processed in <strong>7–14 business days</strong> after approval. Processor/bank delays are extra.</li>
                <li><strong>Refund page and Dispute page are separate.</strong> The Refund page has two forms: Initial Review and Re-Review (appeal). The Dispute page is a separate ticket workflow.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Key Event Rules (Must-Know)</h2>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>Refunds apply <strong>only to Events</strong> that meet the conditions below. Donations, subscriptions, digital goods, promotional items, and completed services are explicitly <strong>non-refundable</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation deadline:</strong> Cancellation requests must be submitted at least <span class="highlight">48 hours</span> before the event’s scheduled start time.</li>
            <li><strong>70% creator agreement:</strong> Creator-initiated cancellations require <span class="highlight">70%+ confirmation (via email)</span> from creators to cancel and trigger refunds. SquadVertex collects confirmations via email. Confirmations are valid up to 12 hours before event start (after that, confirmations don’t count).</li>
            <li><strong>Fees not received:</strong> If a 3-creator event fails to receive the required fees <span class="highlight">24 hours</span> before start, SquadVertex may auto-cancel the event and issue refunds per the 50% rule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. What Happens on Eligible Cancellation / Platform Cancellation</h2>
        <h3>Platform-cancelled for &lt;24-hour fees:</h3>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>If a 3-creator event does not have required fees collected 24 hours before start → SquadVertex cancels the event.</li>
            <li>Paying creators receive a <strong>50% refund</strong> of the amount SquadVertex actually received.</li>
            <li>Non-paying creators receive nothing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> User paid $100; SquadVertex received $90 (after processor). Refund = 50% of $90 = $45. SquadVertex does not top up for GST/processor fees.</p>

        <h3>Creator-initiated cancellation (70% rule):</h3>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>If creators agree (70%+) and request cancellation ≥48 hours before start → paying creators get the same <strong>50% cash refund</strong> rule (calculated on received funds).</li>
            <li>If confirmations fail (threshold not met): <strong>No refund.</strong> SquadVertex keeps funds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Loophole / Postponement Rule (Anti-Gaming)</h2>
        <p>We close the postponement loophole with a clear, enforceable rule:</p>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>Creators may postpone events.</li>
            <li><strong>BUT</strong> if a postponement is used to manipulate the cancellation window (i.e., postpone to a later date so the cancellation request then appears to meet the 48-hour cancel deadline), SquadVertex will treat any cancellation tied to such a postponement as a reduced-refund case.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced refund:</strong> If an event is postponed and the subsequent cancellation occurs after such a postponement that would otherwise game the 48-hour rule, eligible paying creators get a <span class="highlight">30% cash refund</span> (calculated on received funds) instead of 50%. Same confirmation thresholds and rules still apply.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>In short:</strong> you can postpone, but if postponement looks like deadline manipulation and then results in cancellation, refunds shrink to 30%.</p>
        <p class="note">(Why this works: keeps scheduling flexible but removes the incentive to “postpone into eligibility.”)</p>

        <h2>4. Alternative: SVX Points (Goodwill)</h2>
        <p>If SquadVertex decides not to issue cash in some eligible edge cases, it may offer <strong>SVX points equal to 75% of the user’s paid amount</strong> (based on funds received). SVX credits are platform-only, non-transferable, and governed by SVX rules.</p>

        <h2>5. Fraud / EXELIS Security / Immediate Termination (No Mercy)</h2>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>If EXELIS (our security system) detects credible fraud, bots, DDoS, manipulative behavior, or other red flags tied to a user/creator, SquadVertex may immediately terminate accounts and block access.</li>
            <li>In confirmed fraud/cheating cases, <strong>no refunds will be issued</strong> and SquadVertex retains all funds, including donations related to the event.</li>
            <li>If termination looks like a mistake, the affected user may contact support to request a review — SquadVertex reviews at its discretion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Technical Failures & Compensation</h2>
        <p>If platform errors materially affected an event, SquadVertex may compensate. Typical rules:</p>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li><strong>Minor bug</strong> affecting specific user action: support help only (no guaranteed compensation).</li>
            <li><strong>Event-impacting bug:</strong> SquadVertex typically offers <strong>15% compensation</strong> of event money (paid from GP pool) to affected creators. This compensation is in addition to prize pool handling and does not reduce GP balances.</li>
            <li><strong>Severe platform fault:</strong> SquadVertex may issue up to <strong>100% refund</strong> in extreme, demonstrable cases — at SquadVertex’s discretion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the fault was not caused by the platform, no refund/compensation. Strong proof required.</p>

        <h2>7. Explicitly Non-Refundable Items</h2>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>Donations (to creators or platform) — final.</li>
            <li>Digital assets / downloads — final.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions, completed services, promotional items, and any offers without a trial — final.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. How Refunds Are Calculated: Taxes & Fees</h2>
        <p>Refunds are always calculated on the amount SquadVertex actually received from the payment processor. SquadVertex does not reimburse GST or processor fees. It’s the user’s responsibility to handle local tax issues.</p>
        <p class="disclaimer">No disputes about “we’ll top up GST” — SquadVertex will not top up.</p>

        <h2>9. Refund & Review Pages — Form Logic (Practical)</h2>
        <p>Structure on site:</p>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li><strong>Refund Page (page A):</strong> hosts two forms on one page:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Initial Review Form</strong> — submit for first review.</li>
                    <li><strong>Re-Review Form</strong> — one allowed re-review/appeal submission after an initial denial (same page; user picks “re-review”).</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Auto-acknowledge on submit; internal ticket created; human review follows.</li>
            <li>Display clear status: Received → Under review → Approved/Denied → Actioned.</li>
            <li><strong>Dispute Page (page B):</strong> separate ticket workflow for non-refund disputes (e.g., chargeback disputes, account disputes, payout disagreements). Different SLA and escalation flow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="disclaimer">Important UX notes: The Refund page will clearly warn users that reviews are not instant and that SquadVertex may take up to the stated processing window to investigate.</p>

        <h2>10. Refund Form — Required Fields (Initial Review)</h2>
        <p>When users submit the Refund Form (Initial Review), require:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Full name (as per SquadVertex account)</li>
            <li>SquadVertex username / Creator ID</li>
            <li>Account email</li>
            <li>Event name & ID</li>
            <li>Transaction ID(s) / payment references</li>
            <li>Amount paid & currency</li>
            <li>Refund reason: (Event Cancellation / Technical Compensation / Other — specify)</li>
            <li>Date & time of event and issue</li>
            <li>Short description of issue (max 250 words)</li>
            <li>Attachments: original payment proof, logs, timestamps, video, other evidence (clear originals). Screenshots alone may be insufficient.</li>
            <li>Preferred refund method (PayPal email / UPI ID)</li>
            <li>Declaration checkbox (“I confirm accuracy and accept policy terms”)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Auto-acknowledgement sent on submit. SquadVertex reviews and replies per SLA.</p>

        <h2>11. Re-Review (Appeal) Form — Required Fields</h2>
        <p>Same fields as Initial Review + reference to initial ticket number + short appeal statement (100 words max) + any new evidence.</p>
        <p class="disclaimer">One re-review allowed per denied case. SquadVertex’s re-review is final unless otherwise noted.</p>

        <h2>12. Dispute Page / Ticket Fields (Separate)</h2>
        <p>For disputes (non-refund or escalations), require:</p>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>All basic identity and transaction fields (as above)</li>
            <li>Detailed description of dispute & desired outcome</li>
            <li>Attachments (evidence)</li>
            <li>Option to request callback (phone + timezone)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>SquadVertex will open a support ticket and follow escalation internally.</p>

        <h2>13. Processing Time & Communication</h2>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li><strong>Review time:</strong> SquadVertex reviews all refund requests. Reviews are not instant — expect investigation time.</li>
            <li><strong>Approval → payout:</strong> Approved refunds are processed within <strong>7–14 business days</strong>. Bank/processor delays are extra.</li>
            <li><strong>Business hours:</strong> 09:00 — 18:00 <strong>IST (GMT +5:30)</strong>. Sunday is not a business day.</li>
            <li><strong>All official contact:</strong> squadvertex24official@gmail.com.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>14. Chargebacks, Fraud Checks & Withholding</h2>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li>If a chargeback is filed, SquadVertex may temporarily withhold payouts/refunds pending investigation. Users must cooperate.</li>
            <li>SquadVertex reserves the right to deny refunds or reverse payouts where fraud or manipulation is detected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>15. Re-organisation & Event Re-count</h2>
        <p>Cancelled events do not count toward a creator’s event history (if cancelled per policy). Creators may relaunch/ reorganise the event after 14 days. They cannot relaunch instantly to chase gaming rules.</p>

        <h2>16. Re-review Limits, Evidence Standards & Finality</h2>
        <p>SquadVertex requires strong evidence for refunds/technical claims; poor evidence (only screenshots, insufficient logs) may lead to denial. SquadVertex may request additional proof.</p>
        <p>Re-review is limited to one appeal per denied case unless SquadVertex explicitly allows additional review.</p>

        <h2>17. Policy Changes & Acceptance</h2>
        <p>SquadVertex may update this policy. Continued use of the site after changes constitutes acceptance. Major changes will show a new Effective Date at the top.</p>

        <h2>18. Examples (Quick Reference)</h2>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li><strong>Auto-cancel example:</strong> 3-creator event, fees missing 24 hours before start → SquadVertex cancels → paying creators receive 50% of amount received (processed 7–14 business days).</li>
            <li><strong>Creator cancellation via 70% rule:</strong> Creators cancel ≥48 hours before start and 70% confirm → refunds processed as above.</li>
            <li><strong>Postponement manipulation:</strong> Creator postpones to meet cancellation window and then cancels → refunds reduced to 30%.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>19. Contact & Escalation</h2>
        <ul class="list-compact">
            <li><strong>Support email:</strong> squadvertex24official@gmail.com</li>
            <li><strong>Business hours:</strong> 09:00–18:00 IST (GMT +5:30), Sunday closed.</li>
            <li><strong>Refund requests</strong> → Refund Page (Initial Review / Re-Review).</li>
            <li><strong>Disputes</strong> → Dispute Page (ticket workflow).</li>
            <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> reply to support response and request escalation; SquadVertex will review at its discretion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>20. Final Note</h2>
        <p>This policy is designed to be strict, fair, and founder-friendly. Events receive special consideration under specific conditions; all other transactions are final. We encourage the use of postponement for legitimate scheduling needs but will strictly enforce rules against deadline manipulation and fraudulent activity. Attempts to circumvent EXELIS security will result in account termination without recourse. In cases of severe platform failure, we commit to resolving the issue fairly, including up to 100% refunds where warranted.</p>
