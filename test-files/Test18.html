        <h1>SquadVertex — Refund & Dispute Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective:</strong> August 19, 2025</p>

        <div class="tldr">
            <h3>TL;DR: Quick Summary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Only Events</strong> are eligible for cash refunds (under strict conditions).</li>
                <li><strong>Everything else</strong> (donations, subscriptions, digital assets, completed services, promotions, trials) is <strong>explicitly non-refundable</strong>.</li>
                <li>Refunds are <strong>50%</strong> of the amount SquadVertex actually received (after payment processor fees and GST).</li>
                <li>Refunds are processed in <strong>7–14 business days</strong> after approval.</li>
                <li>Use the <strong>Refund Page</strong> for refund requests and appeals. Use the separate <strong>Dispute Page</strong> for all other issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Scope:</strong> This policy applies to all transactions on the SquadVertex website.</p>

        <h2>1. Key Event Rules (Must-Know)</h2>
        <p>Refunds apply only to Events that meet the conditions below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cancellation Deadline:</strong> Requests must be submitted at least <span class="highlight">48 hours</span> before the event’s scheduled start time.</li>
            <li><strong>70% Creator Agreement:</strong> Creator-initiated cancellations require confirmation from <span class="highlight">70% or more</span> of the event's creators (collected via email by SquadVertex) to trigger refunds. Confirmations are valid up to 12 hours before event start.</li>
            <li><strong>Fees Not Received:</strong> If a 3-creator event fails to receive the required fees <span class="highlight">24 hours</span> before its start, SquadVertex may auto-cancel it and issue refunds per the 50% rule.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Eligible Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
        <h3>Platform-Initiated Cancellation (<24-Hour Fees)</h3>
        <p>If a 3-creator event does not have its required fees collected 24 hours before start, SquadVertex will cancel it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Paying creators receive a <strong>50% cash refund</strong> of the net amount SquadVertex received.</li>
            <li>Non-paying creators receive nothing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Creator-Initiated Cancellation (70% Rule)</h3>
        <p>If creators agree (70%+) and request cancellation ≥48 hours before the event starts, paying creators receive a <strong>50% cash refund</strong> of the net amount received.</p>
        <p>If the 70% confirmation threshold is not met, no refund is issued, and SquadVertex retains all funds.</p>

        <h2>3. Refund Calculation & Examples</h2>
        <p>Refunds are calculated solely on the amount SquadVertex actually received from the payment processor, after deductions for GST and processor fees. SquadVertex does not reimburse these fees.</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Scenario</th>
                    <th>Amount User Paid</th>
                    <th>Amount SV Received*</th>
                    <th>Refund (50%)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Standard Event Cancellation</td>
                    <td>$100.00</td>
                    <td>$90.00</td>
                    <td><strong>$45.00</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Postponement Manipulation (30%)</td>
                    <td>$100.00</td>
                    <td>$90.00</td>
                    <td><strong>$27.00</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p class="note">*Example amount. The actual net amount received varies by transaction.</p>

        <h2>4. The Postponement Loophole Rule (Anti-Gaming)</h2>
        <p>Creators may postpone events. However, to prevent manipulation of the cancellation window:</p>
        <p>If a postponement is used to manipulate the policy (e.g., postponing to a later date to make a cancellation request appear to meet the 48-hour deadline), any subsequent cancellation will be treated as a reduced-refund case.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced Refund:</strong> In such cases, eligible paying creators will receive a <span class="highlight">30% cash refund</span> (calculated on received funds) instead of 50%. All standard confirmation thresholds still apply.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Alternative: SVX Points (Goodwill)</h2>
        <p>At its sole discretion, SquadVertex may offer SVX points equal to <strong>75% of the user’s paid amount</strong> (based on funds received) in eligible edge cases instead of a cash refund. SVX credits are for use on the platform only, are non-transferable, and are governed by the SVX Points terms.</p>

        <h2>6. Fraud & Security (EXELIS)</h2>
        <p>If our EXELIS security system detects credible fraud, bots, DDoS, manipulative behavior, or other red flags, SquadVertex may immediately terminate related accounts and block access.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In confirmed cases of fraud or cheating, <strong>no refunds will be issued</strong> under any circumstance, and SquadVertex retains all funds.</li>
            <li>If a user believes their account was terminated in error, they may contact support to request a review at SquadVertex's discretion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Technical Failures & Compensation</h2>
        <p>If a platform error materially affects an event, SquadVertex may offer compensation at its discretion.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minor Bug:</strong> Affecting a specific user action typically results in support assistance only.</li>
            <li><strong>Event-Impacting Bug:</strong> Typically results in a <strong>15% compensation</strong> of the event money (paid from the GP pool) to affected creators.</li>
            <li><strong>Severe Platform Fault:</strong> In extreme, demonstrable cases, SquadVertex may issue up to a <strong>100% refund</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Strong proof is required. No refund or compensation is offered for issues not caused by the platform.</p>

        <h2>8. Explicitly Non-Refundable Items</h2>
        <p>The following are <strong>strictly non-refundable</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Donations (to creators or the platform)</li>
            <li>Digital assets, downloads, or in-platform purchases</li>
            <li>Subscriptions</li>
            <li>Completed services</li>
            <li>Promotional items and any offers without a trial</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <p>All refund requests must be submitted through the official <strong>Refund Page</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Initial Review Form (Required Fields):</h3>

        <h3>Re-Review (Appeal) Process:</h3>
        <p>If your initial request is denied, you may submit <strong>one Re-Review request</strong> on the same Refund Page. You must include:</p>

            <li>The ticket number from your initial request.</li>

        <h2>10. Dispute Process (For Non-Refund Issues)</h2>
        <p>For issues such as chargeback disputes, account disputes, or payout disagreements, you must use the separate <strong>Dispute Page</strong>. This follows a different ticket workflow and escalation process.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>12. Policy Integrity</h2>
        <p>This policy is designed to be fair and transparent for all users. It grants special consideration only to Events under specific conditions, while all other transactions are final. We encourage flexible scheduling but will strictly enforce rules against deadline manipulation and fraudulent activity. Our commitment is to maintain a secure and trustworthy platform. In cases of severe platform error, we will act to rectify the situation fairly.</p>

        <h2>13. Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>SquadVertex may update this policy. Continued use of the site after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms. Major changes will be indicated by a new Effective Date at the top of this page.</p>
