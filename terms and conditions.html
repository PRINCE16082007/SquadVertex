    <h1>SquadVertex Terms and Conditions</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <h2>1. User Agreement</h2>
    <p>By accessing and using SquadVertex services, you agree to abide by these terms and conditions. These terms apply to all users, including subscribers, clients, and visitors. Continued use of the service constitutes acceptance of any changes or updates to these terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Subscription Tiers and Services</h2>
    <p>SquadVertex offers several subscription tiers, each providing different levels of promotional and collaboration opportunities. Detailed descriptions of these plans are available on our pricing page.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Plan:</strong> Includes channel promotion in the "Featured Channels" section at the bottom of the main page.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro Plan:</strong> Offers promotion in the "Spotlight Channel" section with weekly reports on analytics, trends, and optimization tips, with limited features compared to the Premium Plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Plan:</strong> Features top-of-page promotion, collaborations with larger channels, and organic promotion across social media platforms. Subscribers receive fully detailed weekly reports on analytics and growth strategies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All plan details are available, but subscription prices are subject to change. Users will be notified of any updates before their next renewal.</p>

    <h2>3. Content Upload and Rights</h2>
    <p><strong>Content Ownership:</strong> Users retain full ownership of the content they upload to SquadVertex. You may modify, distribute, or remove your content at any time.</p>
    <p><strong>Promotion Rights:</strong> By uploading content, you grant SquadVertex a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use your content for promotional purposes. This may include sharing it on social media, blogs, or other platforms to promote SquadVertex's services and your channel.</p>
    <p><strong>No Liability for Uploaded Content:</strong> SquadVertex is not responsible for any legal or intellectual property disputes arising from the content you upload. Users must ensure their content complies with copyright laws and platform guidelines.</p>

    <h2>4. Communication and Support</h2>
    <p>Due to the current lack of backend support, users will not have individual accounts on the SquadVertex platform. To facilitate communication with the SquadVertex team, users are required to join our official Discord server, where all support, updates, and discussions will take place. A link to the Discord server will be provided upon signing up for our services.</p>

    <h2>5. Cancellation, Upgrades, and Termination</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Subscriptions can only be canceled under specific conditions, such as verified financial hardship. Once canceled, the subscription will not renew, but services will continue until the end of the billing period. Early cancellation does not result in a refund.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrades and Downgrades:</strong> Users can upgrade to a higher tier at any time, with immediate effect. Downgrades will take place at the start of the next billing cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Termination:</strong> If a subscription is not renewed within 48 hours of expiration, the account and associated content will be terminated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>No refunds will be provided for insufficient channel growth or failure to meet the user's performance expectations unless a technical issue caused by SquadVertex is proven. Compensation or refunds will be issued only if the platform is at fault for delays or errors.</p>

    <h2>7. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>Although users won't have direct accounts, any external services, such as payment or communication via Discord, should employ two-factor authentication to secure access. SquadVertex will manually conduct daily content audits to ensure all uploaded content adheres to our community and copyright guidelines.</p>

    <h2>8. Legal Liability and Waiver</h2>
    <p>SquadVertex does not guarantee specific results such as increased subscribers or video views. While the platform provides promotional tools, actual growth depends on factors like content quality and viewer engagement.</p>

    <h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>All disputes related to SquadVertex services will be resolved via arbitration, bypassing traditional court proceedings. By agreeing to these terms, users waive the right to a jury trial for any legal issues arising from the use of SquadVertex.</p>

    <h2>10. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
    <p>SquadVertex will collect limited personal information, including name, email address, phone number, age, place of residence (at least country), and YouTube channel details. This data will be stored securely and accessed only by authorized SquadVertex members.</p>

    <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>SquadVertex reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time. Users will be notified of significant changes, and continued use of the service implies acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
